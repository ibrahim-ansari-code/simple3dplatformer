# Simple 3D Platformer

Basic 3D platformer I made in Unity. Just a simple game where you jump around and collect stuff.

## What it does

- **Rectangle Character**: Play as a blue rectangular character that can move and jump in 3D space
- **Collectible Coins**: Collect yellow spinning coins to increase your score
- **Dangerous Bombs**: Avoid red pulsing bombs that reset your position when touched
- **Multiple Platforms**: Jump between randomly generated platforms of different sizes
- **Boundaries**: Invisible walls prevent you from falling off the level
- **Score System**: Collect all coins to win the game
- **Lives System**: (Future enhancement)

## Controls

- **WASD**: Move forward, backward, left, and right
- **Spacebar**: Jump
- **Arrow Keys**: Alternative movement controls


## How to run

Open in Unity, hit play. WASD to move, space to jump. Collect coins, avoid bombs.

```

## Technical Features

- **Procedural Generation**: Platforms, coins, and bombs are randomly placed each game
- **Physics Integration**: Uses Unity's Rigidbody system for realistic movement
- **Mesh Generation**: All game objects (player, coins, bombs) are created via code
- **Material System**: Dynamic material creation with colors and effects
- **UI System**: Score tracking and game state management
- **Camera System**: Smooth camera following with multiple view options

## Future Enhancements

- Sound effects for jumping, collecting coins, and explosions
- Particle systems for better visual effects
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Better graphics and textures
- Mobile touch controls
- Leaderboard system

## Development Notes

This project demonstrates several Unity and C# concepts:
- Component-based architecture
- Physics simulation
- Procedural mesh generation
- Game state management
- UI integration
- Singleton pattern usage

## System Requirements

- Unity 2022.3.0f1 or newer
- Any platform that supports Unity (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Keyboard for input
